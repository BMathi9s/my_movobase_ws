1. imu_data (sensor_msgs/msg/Imu)

    What it Contains:
    This topic publishes the standard IMU data in a single message. It includes:
        Orientation: Reported as a quaternion (filled in via the EP_CMD_Q_S1_E_ or EP_CMD_COMBO_ cases).
        Angular Velocity: Gyroscope readings (from EP_CMD_Raw_GYRO_ACC_MAG_ or EP_CMD_COMBO_).
        Linear Acceleration: Accelerometer data (again from EP_CMD_Raw_GYRO_ACC_MAG_ or EP_CMD_COMBO_).
        Covariance Matrices: These are populated with fixed values (0.1 for each element), which you might later adjust according to your sensor’s accuracy.

    Usage in SLAM:
    This topic is typically used as the primary source of inertial data for sensor fusion and odometry estimation in SLAM systems.

2. imu_data_mag (sensor_msgs/msg/MagneticField)

    What it Contains:
    This topic is dedicated to the magnetometer data:
        Magnetic Field: The x, y, and z components are filled with magnetometer readings (again coming from EP_CMD_Raw_GYRO_ACC_MAG_ or EP_CMD_COMBO_).

    Usage in SLAM:
    Magnetometer data is often used to help correct heading (yaw) drift and improve overall orientation estimates when fused with the other sensor data.

3. imu_data_rpy (sensor_msgs/msg/MagneticField)

    What it Contains:
    Although the message type is MagneticField, this topic is repurposed to provide Euler angles:
        Roll, Pitch, Yaw: The node assigns the roll, pitch, and yaw values to the magnetic_field.x, .y, and .z fields respectively (populated in the EP_CMD_RPY_ or EP_CMD_COMBO_ cases).

    Usage Considerations:
        Non-Standard Use: The use of a MagneticField message to publish Euler angles is a bit unconventional since that message is normally reserved for magnetic field data.
        Practicality: It might be done for convenience or to avoid creating a custom message type, especially if the consuming nodes are aware of this repurposing.
        Visualization/Debugging: This topic can be very useful if you want to monitor the IMU’s computed orientation in roll, pitch, and yaw directly.

Additional Context from Your Code

    The node uses a timer to periodically read data from the sensor via the serial port.
    Depending on the packet type (as determined by header.cmd), it updates the appropriate fields in the messages.
    For example:
        Raw Data Packets (EP_CMD_Raw_GYRO_ACC_MAG_): Fill in gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer readings.
        Quaternion Packets (EP_CMD_Q_S1_E_): Update the quaternion in the IMU message.
        RPY Packets (EP_CMD_RPY_): Update the repurposed MagneticField message with roll, pitch, and yaw values.
    Covariance matrices are set uniformly (with value 0.1), which is a placeholder until you might adjust these based on sensor noise characteristics.
